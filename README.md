DISCRIPTION ABOUT ASSIGNMENT AND LANGUAGE:  
    The  repository contains  programs written in C++ language.C++ language is a high-level language, however I have used it for basic level which may include Data Types, Variables, Input/Output Operations, Operators ( Arithmatic, logical), Conditional Statements.
   These concepts were convered in an assignment of Programming Fundamentals.MinGW is used as compiler.
